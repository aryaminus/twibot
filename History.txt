== 0.1.7 / 2009-06-01

* New feature - choose how Twibot processes incoming tweets on startup
  (process all, process new [old behaviour], or process from a given ID)
  Bodaniel Jeanes
* Substantially improved error handling. Now survives all common network
  stability issues
* Added a host configuration option. The host name is displayed along all
  output from Twibot. Currently Twitter4R does nothing with this option,
  Twibot knowing about it should make it easier to put Twibot/Twitter4R on
  other services like Laconica instances
