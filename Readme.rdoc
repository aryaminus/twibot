== Description

Twibot (pronounced like "Abbot"), is a Ruby microframework for creating Twitter
bots, heavily inspired by Sinatra.

== Usage

=== Simple example

  require 'twibot'

  # Receive messages, and tweet them publicly
  #
  message do |message, params|
    post_tweet message
  end

  # Respond to @replies if they come from the right crowd
  #
  reply :from => [:cjno, :irbno] do |message, params|
    post_reply message, "I agree"
  end

  # Listen in and log tweets
  #
  tweet do |message, params|
    MyApp.log_tweet(message)
  end

=== Running the bot

To run the bot, simply do:

  ruby bot.rb

=== Configuration

Twibot looks for a configuration file in ./config/bot.yml. It should contain
atleast:

  login: twitter_login
  password: twitter_password

You can also pass configuration as command line arguments:

  ruby bot.rb --login myaccount

...or configure with Ruby:

  configure do |conf|
    conf.login = "my_account"
  do

If you don't specify login and/or password in any of these ways, Twibot will
prompt you for those.

If you want to change how Twibot is configured, you can setup the bot instance
manually and give it only the configuration options you want:

  # Create bot only with default configuration
  require 'twibot'
  bot = Twibot::Bot.new(Twibot::Config.default)

  # Application here...

If you want command line arguments you can do:

  require 'twibot'
  bot = Twibot::Bot.new(Twibot::Config.default << Twibot::CliConfig.new)

=== "Routes"

Like Sinatra, and other web app frameworks, Twibot supports "routes": patterns
to match incoming tweets and messages:

  require 'twibot'

  tweet "time :country :city" do |message,params|
    time = MyTimeService.lookup(params[:country], params[:city])
    client.message :post, "Time is #{time} in #{params[:city]}, #{params[:country]}"
  end

You can have several "tweet" blocks (or "message" or "reply"). The first one to
match an incoming tweet/message will handle it.

As of the upcoming 0.1.5/0.2.0, Twibot also supports regular expressions as routes:

  require 'twibot'

  tweet /^time ([^\s]*) ([^\s]*)/ do |message, params|
    # params is an array of matches when using regexp routes
    time = MyTimeService.lookup(params[0], params[1])
    client.message :post, "Time is #{time} in #{params[:city]}, #{params[:country]}"
  end

=== Working with the Twitter API

The DSL gives you access to your Twitter client instance through "client" (or "twitter"):

  message do
    twitter.status :post, "Hello world" # Also: client.status :post, "Hello world"
  end

== Requirements

Twitter4r. You'll need atleast 0.3.1, which is currently only available from GitHub.
Versions of Twitter4r prior to 0.3.1 does not allow for the since_id parameter to be
appended to URLs to the REST API. Twibot needs these to only fetch fresh messages
and tweets.

== Installation

gem install twibot

== Is it Ruby 1.9?

As of Twibot 0.1.3, yes it is! All tests pass, please give feedback from real world
usage if you have trouble.

== Polling

Twitter pulled the plug on it's xmpp service last year. This means that Twibot backed
bots needs to poll the Twitter service to keep up. Twitter has a request limit on 70
reqs/hour, so you should configure your bot not to make more than that, else it will
fail. You can ask for your bot account to be put on the whitelist which allows you to
make 20.000 reqs/hour, and shouldn't be a problem so long as your intentions are good
(I think).

Twibot polls like this:
* Poll messages if any message handlers exist
* Poll tweets if any tweet or reply handlers exist
* Sleep for +interval+ seconds
* Go over again

As long as Twibot finds any messages and/or tweets, the interval stays the same
(min_interval configuration switch). If nothing was found however, the interval to
sleep is increased by interval_step configuration option. This happens until it
reaches max_interval, where it will stay until Twibot finds anything.
